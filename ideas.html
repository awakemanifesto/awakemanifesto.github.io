<center><h1>Fragments of the idea of Awake Manifesto</h1>

<br><br>


<p><font size="+1">
Our highest priority is to be conscious of our assumption and solution.<br>
Delivering software to customer early and continuously is one of many ways.</font></p>

<br>

<p><font size="+1">
Frameworks, processes, metrics, tools, practices ... <br> are to help us become aware. <br>
When awareness achieved; no framework, no process, no metric, no tool, no practice, nothing is an option.
</font></p>
<br>
<p><font size="+1">
Unawareness introduces bottlenecks. Bottleneck multiplies unawareness.
</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+1">
Ideas, visions, thoughts are shapeless.<br>
Plans, strategies, words are shapeful.<br>
Shapeful cannot fully explain shapeless.
</font></p>
<br>
<p><font size="+1">
Having additional people requires exponential effort to achieve collective consciousness.
</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+1">
We make decision of what we know, we create test for what we donâ€™t.<br>
The less we know, the more we test.
</font></p><br>

<p><font size="+1">
Collective consciousness -- the art of receiving and sharing intentions -- is essential.
</font></p>
<br>
<p><font size="+1">
Continuous attention to technical excellence and <br>
good design allows developers to achieve technical consciousness.
</font></p>
<br>
<p><font size="+1">
Shared awareness is key to proactive collaboration.
</font></p>
<br>

<p><font size="+1">
As we can only change what we are mindful of; <br>
we constantly reflect on our behaviours, thoughts, emotions, no matter how small.
</font></p>
